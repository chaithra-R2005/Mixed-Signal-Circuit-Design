Design and Realization of a Two-Stage Operational Amplifier with Improved Stability

A two-stage operational amplifier is a popular analog circuit used to achieve high voltage gain and a wide output voltage swing. It consists of two main stages a differential amplifier as the input stage, which offers high input impedance and initial gain, and a common-source stage that provides additional amplification to increase the overall gain.

To ensure stable performance, a Miller compensation capacitor is placed between the two stages to manage bandwidth and enhance the phase margin. This configuration offers a good balance between gain, output range, and stability, making it widely suitable for analog ICs, active filters, and signal conditioning applications. Its flexible design also allows easy optimization of parameters such as slew rate, gain-bandwidth product, and power consumption.
